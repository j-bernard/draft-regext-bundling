Basic Requirements of Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Domain Name Mapping  
                 Extension for Bundling Registration

                  draft-bundling-registration-base-00


1.  Introduction

   Bundled domain names are those who share the same TLD but whose
   second level labels are variants, or those who has identical second
   level labels for which certain parameters are shared in different
   TLDs.  For example, Public Interest Registry, request to implement
   technical bundling of second level domains for .NGO and .ONG.  So we
   have two kinds of bundled domain names.  First one is in the form of
   "V-label.TLD" in which the second level labels (V-label) are variants
   sharing the same TLD; Second one is in the form of "LABEL.V-tld" in
   which the second level labels(LABEL) are same with the different TLDs
   (V-tld);

   The basic Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) domain name mapping
   [RFC5731] does
   not specify how to register the bindled names which share some
   attributes.

   In order to meet above requirements of the bundled names
   registration, this document describes basic requirements of extension of the EPP domain
   name mapping [RFC5731] for the provisioning and management of bundled
   names.This document is specified using the Extensible Markup Language
   (XML) 1.0 as described in [W3C.REC-xml-20040204]  and XML Schema
   notation as described in [W3C.REC-xmlschema-1-20041028]  and
   [W3C.REC-xmlschema-2-20041028].

   The EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730] provides a complete
   description of EPP command and response structures.  A thorough
   understanding of the base protocol specification is necessary to
   understand the extension of mapping described in this document.

   This document uses lots of the concepts of the IDN, so a thorough
   understanding of the IDNs for Application (IDNA, described in

   [RFC5890], [RFC5891], and [RFC5892]) and a thorough understanding of
   variant approach discussed in [RFC4290] are both required.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   uLable is defined in [RFC 5890]. uLabel is expressed in this document
   as a number of characters with the format of U+XXXX where XXXX is a
   UNICODE point.

   "b-dn-1.0" in this document is used as an abbreviation for
   urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:b-dn-1.0.

   In examples, "C:" represents lines sent by a protocol client and "S:"
   represents lines returned by a protocol server.  Indentation and
   white space in examples are provided only to illustrate element
   relationships and are not a REQUIRED feature of this specification.

   XML is case sensitive.  Unless stated otherwise, XML specifications
   and examples provided in this document MUST be interpreted in the
   character case presented to develop a conforming implementation.

3.  Definitions

   The following definitions are used in this document:

   o  Registered Domain Name (RDN), represents the valid domain name
      that users submitted for registration by the first time.

   o  Bundled Domain Name (BDN), represents the bundled domain name
      produced according to the bundled domain name registration policy.

4.  Overview

   Bundled names, brought about the need for multiple domain names to be
   registered and managed according to some special policy.  In this
   model, the registry typically accepts a domain registration request
   (i.e.  EPP domain <create> command) containing the domain name to be
   registered.  This domain name is referred to as the RDN in this
   document.  As part of the processing of the registration request, the
   registry or registrar generates a set of bundled names that are
   related to the RDN, either programmatically or with the guidance of
   registration policies, and place them in the registration package
   together with the RDN.  The bundled domain names can be registered separately
   this time or next time.


   
   In current practices, there are many kinds of bundlings. First one is strict bundling, which
   requires all bundled names to share many attributes. When creating, 
   updating, or transfering of any of the bundled domain names,
   all bundled domain names will be created, updated or transferred.
   Second one is partial bundling, which requires that
   at least the bundled domain names if registered should be registered by the same registrant.
   Third one is relax bundling, which has not specific requirements to the domain registration.
     
   In order to avoid the possible phising problem, this document suggests
   all registries or resgrars follow the restrict bundling or partial bundling.


5.  Requirement for Bundling Registration of Names

   The bundled names whether they are in the form of "V-label.TLD" or in
   the form of "LABEL.V-tld" should share some parameter or attributes
   assoicated with domain names.  Typically,

   Strict Bundled names registration will share
   the following parameters or attributes:
   o Registrar Ownership
   o Registration and Expiry Dates
   o Registrant, Admin, Billing, and Technical Contacts
   o Name Server Association
   o Domain Status
   o Applicable grace periods (Add Grace Period, Renewal Grace Period,
   Auto-Renewal Grace Period, Transfer Grace Period, and Redemption
   Grace Period)


    Partial Bundled names registration will share
   the following parameters or attributes: 
   o Registrant, Admin, Billing, and Technical Contacts

     

   Because Strict Bundled names registration and Partial Bundled names registration
   share the same parameters or
   attributes of Registrant, Admin, Billing, and Technical Contacts, 
   the EPP command should do some processing for these
   requirements:

   o When performing a domain Create, either BDN or RDN will be
   accepted.  If the domain name is available, both BDN and RDN will be
   registered.
   

   This document specifies the basic requirements of Extensible Provisioning Protocol (EPP) Domain Name Mapping Extension for Bundling Registration.
   For Strict bundling registration, [ID:draft-ietf-regext-bundling-registration] is recommended;
   For Partial bundling registration, [ID:draft-wilcox-cira-idn-eppext] is recommended.


6.  Object Attributes

   This extension defines following additional elements to the EPP
   domain name mapping [RFC5731].  All of these additional elements can
   be got from <domain:info> command.

6.1.  RDN

   The RDN is an ASCII name or an IDN with the A-label [RFC5890] form.
   In this document, its corresponding element is <b-dn:rdn>.  An
   optional attribute "uLabel" associated with <b-dn:rdn> is used to
   represent the U-label [RFC5890] form.  An optional boolean
   "activated" attribute, with a default true value, is used to indicate
   the presence of the label in the zone file.

   For example: <b-dn:rdn uLabel="U+5B9E""U+4F8B".example> xn--
   fsq270a.example</b-dn:rdn>

6.2.  BDN

   The BDN is an ASCII name or an IDN with the A-label [RFC5890] form
   which is converted from the corresponding BDN.  In this document, its
   corresponding element is <b-dn:bdn>.  An optional attribute "uLabel"
   associated with <b-dn:bdn> is used to represent the U-label [RFC5890]
   form.

   For example: <b-dn:bdn uLabel="U+5BE6""U+4F8B".example> xn--
   fsqz41a.example</b-dn:bdn>


6.3.  IDNtable

   The IDNtable element is based on the repertoireType type defined in
   the extension and is a simple string token limited to several characters.
   The "repertoire" in the [ID:draft-wilcox-cira-idn-eppext] and the "IDNtable"
   in [ID-draft-gould-idn-table] have the similar meaning.

   For example: <b-dn:IDNtable>fr</b-idn:IDNtable>


7.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning and
   managing bundled names via EPP.
   For the IDNtable related to IDN, pls follow the [ID:draft-gould-idn-table].



7.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension defines additional elements to extend the EPP <create>
   command described in the EPP domain name mapping [RFC5731] for
   bundled names registration.

   In addition to the EPP command elements described in the EPP domain
   mapping [RFC5731], the <create> command SHALL contain an <extension>
   element.  The <extension> element SHOULD contain a child
   <b-dn:create> element that identifies the bundle namespace and the
   location of the bundle name schema.

   Example <create> command:

   C:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
   C:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
   C:      <command>
   C:        <create>
   C:              <domain:create
   C:               xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
   C:                <domain:name>xn--fsq270a.example</domain:name>
   C:                <domain:period unit="y">2</domain:period>
   C:                <domain:registrant>123</domain:registrant>
   C:                <domain:contact type="admin">123</domain:contact>
   C:                <domain:contact type="tech">123</domain:contact>
   C:                <domain:authInfo>
   C:                      <domain:pw>2fooBAR</domain:pw>
   C:                </domain:authInfo>
   C:              </domain:create>
   C:        </create>
   C:        <extension>
   C:              <b-dn:create
   C:               xmlns:b-dn="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:b-dn-1.0">
   C:             <b-dn:rdn uLabel="U+5B9E""U+4F8B".example>
   C:                    xn--fsq270a.example</b-dn:rdn>
   C:              </b-dn:create>
   C:        </extension>
   C:        <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
   C:      </command>
   C:</epp>



   When an <create> command has been processed successfully, the EPP
   <creData> element MUST contain child elements as described in the EPP
   domain mapping [RFC5731].  In addition, the EPP <extension> element
   SHOULD contain a child <b-dn:creData> element that identifies the
   extension namespace if the domain object has data associated with
   this extension and based on its service policy.  The <b-dn:creData>
   element contains the <b-dn:bundle> element.

 Example <create> Response for an authorized client:

 S:<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="no"?>
 S:<epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
 S:      <response>
 S:        <result code="1000">
 S:              <msg>Command completed successfully</msg>
 S:        </result>
 S:        <resData>
 S:              <domain:creData
 S:               xmlns:domain="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
 S:                <domain:name>xn--fsq270a.example</domain:name>
 S:                <domain:crDate>1999-04-03T22:00:00.0Z</domain:crDate>
 S:                <domain:exDate>2001-04-03T22:00:00.0Z</domain:exDate>
 S:              </domain:creData>
 S:        </resData>
 S:        <extension>
 S:              <b-dn:creData
 S:               xmlns:b-dn="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:b-dn-1.0">
 S:                <b-dn:bundle>
 S:                      <b-dn:rdn uLabel="U+5B9E""U+4F8B".example
 S:                       >xn--fsq270a.example</b-dn:rdn>
 S:                      <b-dn:bdn uLabel="U+5BE6""U+4F8B".example
 S:                       >xn--fsqz41a.example</b-dn:bdn>
 S:                </b-dn:bundle>
 S:              </b-dn:creData>
 S:        </extension>
 S:        <trID>
 S:              <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
 S:              <svTRID>54322-XYZ</svTRID>
 S:        </trID>
 S:      </response>
 S:</epp>

   <create> Response for the unauthorized client has not been
   changed,see [RFC5731] for detail.

   An EPP error response MUST be returned if an <create> command cannot
   be processed for any reason.






7.2.  Other Commands
    
   Any other commends are not changed. But if the registries/registrars try to follow specific bundling registration,
 For Strict bundling registration, [ID:draft-ietf-regext-bundling-registration] is recommended;
   For Partial bundling registration, [ID:draft-wilcox-cira-idn-eppext] is recommended.
